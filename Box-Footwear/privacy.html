					Box Privacy Notice
	Last Updated: June 18, 2018

	Data privacy is important to the Box group of companies which includes Box, Inc., Box.com (UK) Ltd and their affiliates (“Box”). This Privacy Notice ("Privacy Notice") explains how information is collected, used and disclosed by Box and applies to information collected when you use or access our online or mobile websites (such as www.box.com), products, services or applications (collectively, the "Box Services"), or when you attend a Box event or otherwise interact with us. We respect the privacy rights of users and recognize the importance of protecting information collected about you. If you use the Box Services as part of an entity or organization that has an agreement with Box (like your employer or a university), the terms of that organization’s contract for the Box Services may restrict our collection or use of your information more than what is described in this Privacy Notice. .

	Please read the following carefully to understand how we will collect, use and maintain your personal information. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.

	Changes to This Notice
	We may change this Privacy Notice from time to time. If we make any changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Notice and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). If there are material changes to this Privacy Notice, we will notify you more directly by email or means of a notice on the home page prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to review our Privacy Notice whenever you access the Box Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

	If you disagree with any changes to this Privacy Notice and do not wish your information to be subject to the revised Privacy Notice, you will need to deactivate with us and stop using the Box Services. Your use of any of the Box Services after the posting of such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.

	Information Collected
	We may collect certain user information (including personal information and/or sensitive personal information) in the following ways:

	Information You Provide To Us. We collect information you provide directly to us including when you visit one of our websites, register for and/or use one of the Box Services.

	For example, we collect information when you register with Box for an account, create or modify your profile and online account, access and use the Box Services (including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or share files or other information), participate in any interactive features of the Box Services, participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstakes, activity or event, make a purchase, apply for a job, request customer support, or communicate with us via third-party social media sites

	The types of information we may collect directly from you include your name, username, email address, your picture, postal address, phone number, information about your data storage preferences, employer’s name, job title, transactional information (including services purchased or subscribed to and billing address) as well as any contact or other information you choose to provide. Please be aware that the information you choose to provide in your Box profile may reveal or identify information that is not expressly stated (for example, if you choose to provide your picture, your picture may reveal your gender. We also store the files or other information that you upload or provide to the Box Services ("Content") in order to be able to provide you with the features and functionality of the Box Service.

	The information of third parties such as name, email address, etc. as may be provided to enable the functionality and features of the Box Service. For example, if you invite a user to Box, we will collect their email address in order to provide them with an invite to the Box Service in order to collaborate on the Content you designated.

	Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Box Services. When you access or use the Box Services, we may automatically collect information about you, including:

	Usage Information: We monitor user activity in connection with the Box Services and may collect information about the applications and features you use, the websites you visit, the sizes and names of the files or folders you upload, download, share or access while using the Box Services, the Content you access and any actions taken in connection with the access and use of your Content in the Box Services.

	Log Information: We log information about you when you access and use the Box Services including your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, access times, browser type and language, Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), the Web pages that you visit, the Content you use and the URL of the Web page you visited before navigating to the Box Services.

	Device Information: If you access the Box Services from a mobile device, we collect information about the device, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, mobile network information (as allowed by the mobile network) or platform information (as allowed by the specific platform type). We may ask for or access your location based information from your mobile device with your consent through our mobile apps. You can enable or disable this functionality in the Box mobile application settings. If you experience an error or crash in any of the Box Services, we may collect data (using first or third party products) and logs from your device including information such as your device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, application configuration(s), the time and date, and other statistics.

	Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:  We (including service providers who are working on our behalf) use various technologies to collect information, which may include saving cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to improve the Box Services and your experience, customize your experience and preferences, allow you to access and use the Box Services without re-entering your member ID and/or password, understand which areas and features of the Box Services are most popular and count visits. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"). Web beacons are electronic images (also called "gifs") that may be used in the Box Services or in emails that help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see "Your Choices" below.

	Third party cookies: If you sign-up for, access, or log into the Box Services using third-party services, those third-party services may use cookies that are subject to those third-party services' own rules and policies. Box does not control the use of cookies by such third-party services. For more information around how you may be able to control the use of those cookies and other tracking technologies please see the Opting Out of Cookies and Advertising section below.

	Third Party clear gifs: Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our website. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personal information.

	Local Shared Objects (“LSO”): We use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information in order to provide certain features on our website. Third parties with whom we partner may also use LSOs in order to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.

	Google AdSense: We use Google AdSense to publish ads on this website. When you view or click on an ad a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other websites. You may opt-out of the use of this cookie by visiting Google’s Advertising and Privacy page: http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html

	Advertising Cookies: We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other websites. Our third parties may use tracking technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this website and other websites you visit in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

	Opting Out of Cookies and Advertising
	You may opt out of behaviorally targeted ads anytime by deleting your browser's cookies. In addition, you may opt-out of interest-based advertising from some third-party partners by visiting  http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/, http://www.youronlinechoices.eu, or the third-party provider’s websites.

	Please note that opting-out will only prevent targeted ads so you may continue to see generic (non-targeted ads) after you opt-out.


	Do Not Track. Some browsers offer a “do not track” (“DNT”) option. Because no common industry or legal standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, we do not respond to DNT signals. We will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.

	Information We Collect From Other Sources. We may also obtain information from third parties and combine that with information we collect through the Box Services. For example, we may have access to certain information from a third-party social media service if you create or log into your online account through the service or otherwise provide us with access to information from the service. Any access that we may have to such information from a third-party social media service is in accordance with the privacy notice and authorization procedures determined by the social media service. We protect data obtained from third parties according to the practices described in this policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data.

	Use of Information
	We may use the information collected for the limited purpose of providing the Box Service and related functionality and services, as described in this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable laws. These limited purposes include circumstances where it is necessary to provide or fulfill Services requested by or for you or where you have given us your express consent.
	The information may be used to perform a variety of purposes, including to:

	Enable you to access and use the Box Services, including uploading, downloading, collaborating on and sharing Content and sending emails on your behalf;

	In some cases, we may share your information with third-party vendors to understand which areas and features of the Box Services are most popular and/or to improve the overall effectiveness of Box's Services and features.

	Corporate Account:  If you are an individual Box registered user and the domain of the primary email address associated with your Box account is owned by your employer and was assigned to you as an employee of that organization, and such organization wishes to establish a Box corporate account, then certain information concerning past use of your individual account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator including your email address.

	For Collaboration:  We may share your information, including when you choose to use collaboration features in the Box Services that by their nature support sharing with third parties who you choose. Your name, email address, information from your profile and online account (including your photo), and any Content you choose to share will be shared with such third parties, and such third parties may communicate with you (such as by posting comments or emailing you) in connection with your use of the collaboration features of the Box Services. For example, third parties who you invite to collaborate with you as “Editors” using the collaboration features of the Box Services may also modify Content that you have shared, upload documents and photos to Content you have shared, share such Content outside of the Box Services, and provide other third parties with rights to view the Content you have shared.

	Third Party Applications:  Box provides you with opportunities to connect with third-party applications or services, such as through our Box One Cloud or Box application partner ecosystem.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their information and privacy practices.
